= How it works =

== Initial settings ==
The plugin will turn off automatic building.
It will set circular dependencies as an error.
It will set incomplete build path problems to warning only.
It will set the name of the default jre to 'JRE'. (some JST tool uses direct references to named installed JREs), so we used this name in our projects.

== Importing projects ==
This plugin can import projects into the workspace, so it can initialize a directory as a workspace. It very useful in case CI. It will checkout the projects, this plugin will import them into the workspace.

== Correcting build order ==
After importing, it will correct the build order. It is necessary because dynamic project references can be missing due to improper importing order. This is done using "touch" on a selected of resources (.project, .classpath, etc.).

== Building ==
It is now nearly ready for the build. But what about external tool builders? Ant needs the gui to be initialized. So a workbench must be initialized (in invisible mode). Another problem with and is the console. I haven't achieved to catch output on Console. So I change the external tool builders' launch configuration to log output to a file, and I poll this file instead. (At the end, the launch configs will be reverted)

So, it is now possible to call builds (clean, and workspace build). The workspace build will start a full build after a clean or after a pure import, otherwise it will start incremental (or manual) build. It is good to remember this if you wish to use external tool builders.
